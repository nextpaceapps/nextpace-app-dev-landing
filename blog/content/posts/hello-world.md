# Building This Website: Our Tech Stack and Approach

Hey there! I wanted to share a bit about how we put this site together. It's been a fun project, and I thought it might be interesting to walk through what we're using under the hood.

## The Stack

We went with **React** for the frontend. It's what we know best, and honestly, it just makes sense for this kind of site. We're using **TypeScript** too – I know some people find it overkill, but catching errors before they hit production? Worth it every time.

For styling, we're using **SCSS modules**. I like keeping styles scoped to components. It prevents those "where the hell is this style coming from?" moments at 2 AM.

The whole thing is hosted on **Firebase**. Super easy to deploy, and it just works. We're also using **AWS SES** for emails – reliable and cheap, which is exactly what we need.

## The Blog

You're reading this on our blog, which is built with **Hugo**. Yeah, I know, mixing a static site generator with a React app might seem weird, but it works great. Hugo generates the blog as static HTML, and it sits alongside the React app. Simple, fast, and easy to maintain.

## Why This Approach?

Honestly? Speed and simplicity. We wanted something we could build fast, deploy easily, and not overthink. No fancy frameworks, no unnecessary complexity. Just solid tools that do their job well.

The design uses a dark theme with cyan and fuchsia accents – we call it the "neonic" theme. It's got that tech startup vibe without being too flashy.

## What's Next?

We'll be sharing more about our projects, the tools we use, and maybe some lessons learned along the way. If you're curious about anything specific, feel free to reach out!

Thanks for checking us out.
