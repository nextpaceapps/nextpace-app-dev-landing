# Implementation Plan: Hugo-Based Blog Integrated at /blog Route

**Branch**: `004-hugo-blog` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-hugo-blog/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Integrate a Hugo-based blog at the `/blog` route that builds to a subdirectory and is served as static HTML alongside the React application. The blog will use Hugo static site generator, maintain design consistency with the neonic theme (dark backgrounds, cyan/fuchsia accents), support traditional pagination (5 posts per page), use flat URL structure (`/blog/post-slug`), and include static HTML versions of the main website's header and footer for seamless integration.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Hugo (latest stable version), Go (for Hugo), Markdown (for blog content)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Hugo static site generator, Hugo theme customization, SCSS/CSS for styling  
**Storage**: N/A (static files generated by Hugo, content stored as Markdown files in Hugo content directory)  
**Testing**: Manual testing, browser DevTools for responsive design verification, Hugo build verification  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (modern browsers supporting HTML5, CSS3), Firebase Hosting  
**Project Type**: Static site generation (Hugo) integrated with web application (React SPA)  
**Performance Goals**: Blog pages load and display content within 2 seconds on standard broadband connections (SC-002)  
**Constraints**: WCAG AA accessibility standards (minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio), responsive breakpoints at 768px (mobile), 1024px (desktop), design must match neonic theme exactly  
**Scale/Scope**: Hugo blog site with custom theme, integration with existing React app, support for blog posts with markdown content, pagination for multiple posts

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Note**: No project-specific constitution file found. Proceeding with standard web development best practices:
- Static site generation patterns (Hugo)
- Design system consistency (neonic theme)
- Accessibility standards (WCAG AA)
- Responsive design patterns

**Gates**: ✅ PASS - No violations detected. Feature aligns with existing codebase patterns and static site generation best practices.

src/                    # Existing React app (unchanged)

├── pages/
└── App.tsx
```

**Structure Decision**: Hugo blog will be a separate directory structure (`blog/`) at the repository root. Hugo builds to `dist/blog/` subdirectory which is served alongside the React app's `dist/` output. The Hugo theme (`blog/themes/neonic-blog/`) will contain custom templates and styling matching the neonic design system. Content is stored in `blog/content/posts/` as Markdown files.
